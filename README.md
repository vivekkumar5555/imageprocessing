This readme provides an overview and instructions for using the image processing functionality in your project. Image processing involves manipulating and modifying digital images to enhance their quality, extract useful information, or apply various transformations.

Features

Image Filtering : Apply filters to images to enhance or modify their appearance. This can include techniques such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, or noise reduction.

Image Enhancement : Adjust the brightness, contrast, or color balance of images to improve their visual quality.

Image Restoration : Restore degraded or damaged images by removing artifacts, noise, or imperfections.

Image Segmentation : Divide an image into meaningful regions or objects for further analysis or processing.

Image Compression : Reduce the file size of images while preserving their visual quality, allowing for efficient storage and transmission.

Image Transformation : Perform geometric transformations such as rotation, scaling, or cropping to modify the spatial arrangement of image content.

Feature Extraction : Extract meaningful features from images, such as edges, corners, textures, or shapes, for analysis or pattern recognition tasks.

Object Recognition : Identify and classify objects or patterns within images using techniques like machine learning or computer vision algorithms. Installation To use the image processing functionality in your project, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies : Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This may include image processing libraries or frameworks such as OpenCV, Pillow, scikit-image, or MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox. Refer to the project documentation for specific requirements.

Import the Library : Import the image processing library into your project. Depending on the programming language or framework you are using, this can be done through an import statement or by adding the library as a dependency in your project configuration.

Load and Process Images : To process images, load the image file into your program using the provided functions or methods. Apply the desired image processing techniques, such as filtering, enhancement, or transformation, to modify the image. Make sure to follow the library's documentation and guidelines for proper usage of the provided functions.

Save or Output the Processed Images : Once the image processing is complete, save or output the processed images. This can be done by using the library's provided functions or methods to write the processed image data to a file or display it in a graphical user interface
